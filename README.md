The Face Recognition System is a software application that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to perform real-time face detection, recognition, and embedding. It allows you to capture faces from a webcam, extract facial features, and compare them against known faces to identify individuals.

## Features:

- Real-time face detection: The system uses the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) model to detect faces in real-time from a webcam feed.

- Facial feature extraction: It utilizes the InceptionResNetV1 model to extract high-dimensional face embeddings, which represent unique facial features.

- Face recognition: The system enables you to compare the extracted face embeddings with a database of known embeddings to perform face recognition and identify individuals.

- User-friendly interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface to capture faces, display bounding boxes, and present recognition results.

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- facenet-pytorch

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-system.git

2.Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage:

    1.Run the application:
    
        python main.py
        
    2.When prompted, enter the name of the person whose face you want to capture.

    3.The webcam feed will open, and faces will be detected and highlighted with bounding boxes.

    4.Press the 'q' key to capture an image when the desired face is detected.

    5.The captured image will be saved as a JPEG file with the person's name.


## Future Enhancements:

    1.Improved face recognition accuracy: Fine-tune the face recognition model to enhance accuracy and robustness.

    2.Expand the database: Develop functionality to maintain a database of known faces for reliable recognition.

    3.Facial expression analysis: Incorporate facial expression analysis to detect emotions and estimate mood.

    4.Face tracking: Implement face tracking to enable tracking a specific person across frames.
